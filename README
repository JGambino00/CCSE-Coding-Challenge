The apprach for this solution is that when the HTML page is loaded, the fetch function makes a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API. After doing so, blog cards will be dynamically created. As said in the JSONPlaceholder documentation, the get request will return 100 posts. In order to create each card, a loop will go through each JSON element and create card elements using the posts title and body. These elements are then appended to the blog div (blogcards.html). A delete button is also added to each card element and has an event listener for when it is clicked. Upon clicking the delete button the child card will simply be removed from the blog. The DELETE method that JSONPlaceholder provides can also be used to perform an API request to delete the post (This was not implemented).
